# Build Your Own Vehicle

## Description

My motivation behind this project is to allow users to create their own vehicle and do things with them in the terminal.

I built this project for vehicle enthusiasts to have some fun.

It creates entertainment in a coding terminal.

I learned various ways to(and not to) confirm if an object meets certain requirements before moving forward on a topic.

My project is simple and easy to use, with a simple start command and easy understanding for the user.
